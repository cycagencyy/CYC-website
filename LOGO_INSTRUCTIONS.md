# Adding Your CYC Logo

## Instructions

To use your actual CYC logo in the website, please follow these steps:

### 1. Save Your Logo
- Save your CYC logo image as `logo.png` in the same folder as the website files
- The logo should be in PNG format for best quality
- Recommended size: 200x200 pixels or higher (it will be automatically resized)

### 2. Logo Specifications
- **Format**: PNG (preferred) or JPG
- **Size**: Minimum 200x200 pixels
- **Background**: Your logo has a black background with light text, which will work perfectly
- **Transparency**: Not required (your black background will look great)

### 3. File Location
Place your logo file here:
```
cyc-website/
├── index.html
├── styles.css
├── app.js
├── logo.png          ← Your logo goes here
└── README.md
```

### 4. What's Already Updated
✅ All logo references in the HTML have been updated to use `logo.png`
✅ CSS styling has been optimized for your logo design
✅ Schema.org structured data updated
✅ Navigation and footer logos ready

### 5. Testing
After adding your logo:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Check that the logo appears in:
   - Navigation bar (top left)
   - Footer (bottom left)
3. Verify the logo looks good on both desktop and mobile

### 6. Alternative Formats
If you have your logo in a different format:
- **JPG**: Save as `logo.jpg` and update the HTML references
- **SVG**: Save as `logo.svg` for crisp scaling at any size
- **Other formats**: Convert to PNG for best compatibility
